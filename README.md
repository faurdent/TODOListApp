# TODO List App

### Brief description

Application, that will help you organize your time and everyday tasks. Sometimes our workload becomes so heavy that it is impossible to keep
all the plans in our heads. My aim is to create a light, small and intuitive time management application.
Feel free to use and modify source code in this repository. This app is being developed as microservice, so you will be able to take some of the functionality,
or connect it completely as an independent application using docker containers.

### Backend
1. JWT-based authentication(tokens refreshing in plans)
2. CRUD for tasks:
    * GET /my-tasks/{id} - get task
    * PUT /my-tasks/{id} - update task
    * DELETE /my-tasks/{id} - delete task
    * POST /my-tasks/{day_id} - create task for day with specified id
